It is possible to run JudoShiai software in Raspberry Pi. Most probably you may
want to use JudoInfo or JudoTimer in slave mode. Instructions:

* Download Debian Wheezy image from http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_latest

* Copy image to a memory card. Instructions:
   http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md

   8 GB is a good choice for the card size. More info here:
   http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/sd-cards.md

* First boot requires a TV set or monitor with an HDMI interface and a keyboard:
   http://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/raspi-config.md

   Expand the file system and enable boot to desktop. From Advance options
   check that SSH server is enabled.

*  Connect Raspberry Pi to internet. Since you most probably have not configured
   WiFi use an Ethernet cable. There is a Terminal program in the menus. Find it
   and open a terminal window. Terminal uses text "pi@raspberrypi ~ $" as a prompt.
   Everything after the prompt is typed by you.

*  First it is best to update the software database:
      pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get update
   - sudo means you use root (admin) privileges.
   - apt-get is a software package tool.
   - Type 'man sudo' and 'man apt-get' (without quotes) to have more information.

*  Next you have to upload the JudoShiai software package to the Raspberry Pi.
   You can use the RPI's web browser and download the software from Sourceforge, but
   here we use SSH. Find out your RPI's IP address:
      pi@raspberrypi ~ $ ifconfig
   You will see something like this:

      eth0      Link encap:Ethernet  HWaddr 28:d2:44:1c:ee:3d
                inet addr:192.168.1.101  Bcast:192.168.1.255  Mask:255.255.255.0

   Your IP address is 192.168.1.101.
   - In Linux the command would be:
     LINUX> scp judoshiai_x.x-1_armhf.deb pi@192.168.1.101:.
     (password is raspberry if you have not changed it)
   - In Windows you can use software like Putty.

*  Now you have the software package in your home directory. Install it:
      pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo dpkg -i judoshiai_x.x-1_armhf.deb
   (name depends on the version)
   There will be complaint about missing dependencies. Fix it:
      pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get install -f
   Try to start JudoTimer form the menus or from command line:
      pi@raspberrypi ~ $ judotimer

*  You may want to start an application automatically after booting.
   Create a file to directory /home/pi/.config/autostart for each
   application that should start after the desktop is up. To start JudoInfo
   make a file /home/pi/.config/autostart/judoinfo.desktop. 
   - Make directory if it doesn't exist:
       pi@raspberrypi ~ $ mkdir .config/autostart
   - Use nano as your editor and open the file:
       pi@raspberrypi ~ $ nano .config/autostart/judoinfo.desktop
   - Add the following lines:

      [Desktop Entry]
      Encoding=UTF-8
      Type=Application
      Name=JudoInfo
      Comment=
      Exec=/usr/bin/judoinfo
      StartupNotify=false
      Terminal=true
      Hidden=false

   - Save file (ctl-O) and exit (ctl-X).

   - To start JudoTimer in slave mode create file judotimer.desktop with content

      [Desktop Entry]
      Encoding=UTF-8
      Type=Application
      Name=JudoTimer
      Comment=
      Exec=/usr/bin/judotimer -s
      StartupNotify=false
      Terminal=true
      Hidden=false

*  Hint: You can do many things remotely without connecting any keyboard or mouse to the RPI.
   Use SSH (Putty) to connect to the IP address you found earlier. Connection gives you
   a command line with prompt like the Terminal window above.

*  Hint: To remotely control the desktop you can use x11vnc. Installation:
       pi@raspberrypi ~ $ sudo apt-get install x11vnc
   Create file /home/pi/.config/autostart/x11vnc.desktop
   with content

      [Desktop Entry]
      Encoding=UTF-8
      Type=Application
      Name=X11VNC
      Comment=
      Exec=x11vnc -forever -nopw -display :0 -tightfilexfer
      StartupNotify=false
      Terminal=false
      Hidden=false

   You need a VNC client for your Linux/Windows computer. There are many implementations
   available for many platforms.
